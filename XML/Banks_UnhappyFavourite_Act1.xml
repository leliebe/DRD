                        <l>When Tops of Hills the Longing Patriarch saw, </l>
                        <l>And the new Scene of Earth began to draw; </l>
                        <seg>The Dove was sent to View the Waves Decrease, </seg>
                        <l>And first brought back to Man the Pledge of Peace: </l>

                        <l>Who bring the Olive, and who Plant it here. </l>
                        <l>We have before our eyes the Royal Dove, </l>

                        <l>And loath the Manna of his dayly food? </l>
                        <l>Must England still the Scene of Changes be, </l>
                        <l>Tost and Tempestuous like our Ambient Sea? </l>
                        <l>Must still our Weather and our Wills agree? </l>
                        <l>Without our Blood our Liberties we have, </l>
                        <l>Who that is Free would Fight to be a Slave? </l>

                        <l>Of which our Present Age is not secure? </l>
                        <l>All that Our Monarch would for us Ordain, </l>
                        <l>Is but t'Injoy the Blessings of his Reign. </l>
                        <l>Our Land's an Eden, and the Main's our Fence, </l>
