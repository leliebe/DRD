Fation is a Monſter that of. ten makes the ſlaughter 'twas deſigned for; and as often turns its fury on thoſe that hatcht it. The Moral therefore of theſe Scenes being to Recommend Submiſſion and Adherence to Fſtabliſht Lawful Tower, which in a word, is 3LOyalty; They have ſo far ama- tural Claim to your Lordſhip's Acceptance: This Virtue ſeeming In- heritance in Tour Lordſhip, and deriv'd from your Anceſtours with Your Blood. We cannot caſt an Eye on the ſufferings of His late Majeſty, but we find in broad Letters, the Allegiance and Seroi. ces of Tour Lordſhip's moſt honourable Grand-Father, who ſtopt at no Expence of Blood or Fortunes on His behalf; nor was Pro- vidence wanting to Crown his Singular worth with a Signal Glory. When Civil Diſcord thro’ the Realm had Reign'd, And Engliſh Swords with Engliſh Blood were Stain'd, When out of Zeal Religion was expell’d, And Men for Conſcience 'gainſt their Prince Rebell'd, Th le cº,
