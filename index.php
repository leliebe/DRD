            </div>
            <p class="intro">
                Digital Restoration Drama seeks to expand electronic access to plays from the English
                  Restoration. Currently, the project is limited to plays performed, printed, or written
                  between 1660 and 1685, covering the reign of Charles II. Though initial phases have largely
                  focused on commercially produced plays performed in London theaters, there are plans to
                  extend the site’s coverage to include closet and manuscript drama and plays produced for
                  the Smock Alley Theater in Dublin.

              Designed as a supplement to projects such as <a href="https://digitalrenaissance.uvic.ca/">Digital Renaissance Editions</a>,
              the <a href="https://londonstagedatabase.usu.edu/">London Stage Database</a>, and
              the Folger Shakespeare Library’s <a href="https://earlymodernenglishdrama.folger.edu/">Digital Anthology of Early Modern English Drama</a>,
              Digital Restoration Drama offers TEI-encoded, lightly-edited, full-text editions of plays,
              supported by metadata reflecting the publication and performance histories of each text.

                    We've added the full text of Edward Ravenscroft's <i>Titus Andronicus; or, The Rape of Lavinia</i>!
                          This adaptation of Shakespeare's <i>Titus Andronicus</i> premiered during the Popish Plot. While it largely
                          follows Shakespeare's source text (although Ravenscroft begins the long-standing trend of denying Shakespeare's)
                          authorship, it also demonstrates its Restoration roots through its emphasis on visual spectacle, culminating in
                          a final banquet scene that surpasses its Shakespearean predecessor. Find the full text here
