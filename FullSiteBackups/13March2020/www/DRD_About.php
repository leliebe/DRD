    <p>Digital Restoration Drama is an open access database of play texts from the English Restoration.
By providing TEI-encoded texts alongside metadata about the publications and performances of these plays,
this project hopes to advance the study of Restoration drama through expanded access. Restoration drama has
been relatively underrepresented in modern publication and scholarship, especially compared to the weight given
to drama before 1642. From this lack of study, a symbiotic relationship has developed: because these plays are
not frequently written about or taught, they are infrequently published, and they are infrequently published
because scholarship has not created a substantial demand for new (and expensive) print editions. Digital
Restoration Drama hopes to break this cycle by making these texts easily available in a free, clean, digital
format suitable for both scholarly and classroom use.</p>
