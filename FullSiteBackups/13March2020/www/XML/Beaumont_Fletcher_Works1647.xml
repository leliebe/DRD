O e t r y is the Child of Nature, which regulated and wade beaut ipill by Art, prefenteth the moft Harmonious of all other compofitions • among which (if we rightly con fidcr ) the Dra- maticall is the moft abftolute, in regard of thofe tranfcendent A- bilities, which fhould waite upon the Compoler; who mufl have more then the infruUion of Libraries which of itfelfe is but a cold contem¬ plative knowledge) there being required in him a Soule miraculoufly Qlowing, and converftng with all mankind, inabling him to expreffe not onely the Phlegme andfolly of thick-skin d men, but the ftrengtb and maturity of the wife, the zAireand infnuations of the Court, the difcipline and R efolution of the Sol¬ diery theVertues andpafsions of every noble condition, nay the councells and characters of the greatefl Princes. I his you mil fay is a vafl comprehenfion, and hath not hapned in many vAges. Be it then remembred to the Glory ofour owne, that all theje are Demonfrah ve and met in Be aumont F lei ,wbom but to mention is to throw a cloude upon all former names and benight Pofterity; This Boob^ being, without flattery, the greatefl Monument of the Scene that Time and Humanity haveproduced, and muft Live, not only the Crowne andfole Reputation of our owne, but the ftayne of all other Nations and Lan guages, for it may he boldly averred, not one indifcretion hath branded this Paper in all the Lines, this being the An'ben- tick witt that made Blackftriers an Academy, where the three bowersfpeffacle while Beaumont and Fletcher were prefented, wereufually of more advantage; to the hopef nilyoung Heire,thenacoflly, dangerous, forraigne Jravell, with the j afliflance of a governing Mounfleur, or Signior to boot; <?_And it cannot be deniedj but that tbeyoungfpirits of the T ime,whofe Birth & Quality made them impati¬ ent of the fowrerwayes of education,have from the attentive hearing thefe pieces, got ground in point of wit and carriage of the mofl flverely employed Students, | while thefe Recreations were digefted into Rules, and the very Pleafure did edi- fie.

The Stationer to the Readers. GentlemenJ |N^Efore you engage farther, be pleafed to take notice of thefe Particu- lars. You have here a Bookie ; I can lpeake it clearely j for of all this large Uolume of Comedies und Tragedies, not one, till now, was e- ver printed before. A Colleffion of'Tlayes is commonly but a new 1m- > prefsion, the fcattered pieces which were printed fingle, being then onely Republifhed together : 'Tb otherwife here. Nex t, as it is all New, fo here is not any thing Spurious or impos'd; I had the Ori- ginalls from fuch as received them from the Autbours themfelves 5 by Thofe,and none other, I publifh this Edition. , And as here's nothing but what is genuine and Theirs, fo you will finde here are no Omifpons; you have not onely All I could get, but All that you muft ever expecf. For ( befides thofe which were formerly printed ) there is not any Piece written by thefe Autbours, either Joyntly or Severally , but what are now publiih'd to the World in this Volume. One only Play I muft except £ for I meane to deale openly } 'tis a CO M ED T called the VVilde-goofe Chafe, which hath beene long loft , and I feare irrecoverable j for a rPerfon of quality borrowed it from the Amours many yeares fince , and ( by the negligence of a Servant) it was never returned • therefore now I put up this Si quit, that whofoever hereafter happily meetes with it,fhall be thank¬ fully fatisfied if he pleafe to fend it home. Some Tlayes Q you know ) written by thefe Authors were heretofore Printed: I thought not convenient to mixe them with this Volume^ which of it felfe is entirely New. And indeed it would have rendred theBooke fo Voluminous, that Ladies and r • t 4 _ ± * a > . .* . * " j Gentlewomen would have found it fearce manageable, who in Workes of this nature muft ftrft be remembred. Befides, I confidered thofp former Pieces had been fo long printed and re-printed, that many Gentlemen were already furnifhed ^ and I would have none fay, they pay twice for the fame BooJ^e,, One thing I muft anfwer before it bee obje&ed ; 'tis this >. When thefe Comedies and Tragedies were prefented on the Stage, the dttours omitted fome Scenes and Paf- lages(with the Autbour s confent)as occafion led them ; and when private friends de- fir'd a Copy, they then ("and juftly too) tranfcribed what they Ailed. But now you have both All that was Ailed, and all that was not; even the without the leaft mutilation; So that were the Authours living,(and fure they can ne¬ ver dye ) they themfelves would challenge neither more nor leflefthen what is here publifhed ; this Volume being now fo compleate and finiflf d, that the Reader muft cxpe<ft no future Alterations.

The Stationer to»he R eader * «» ♦' For literall Err ours committed by the Printer, Jtis the fafhion to aske pardon , and I as much in fafhion to take no notice of hirn that asks it ; but in this alio I have done j my endeavour. J Fwere vaine to mention the C hargeablenejje of this Work j tor thole | who own'd the MamJcripts} too well knew their value to make a cheap eftimate of! any ofthefe Pieces,and though another joyn'd with me in the Eur chafe 2nd Printing, j yet the Care & Paws was wholly mine,which I found to be more then you'l eafily im-1 agine, unlefleyou knew into how many hands the Originalls were difperfed. They! are all now happily met in this Book, having efcaped thefe Publike Troubles, free and i unmangled. Heretofore when Gentlemen defired but a Copy of any of thefe'Playes, the meaneft piece here(if any may be called Meane where every one is Bcft^colf them j more then foure times the price you pay for the whole Volume. I fliould fcarce have adventured in thefe flippery times on fuch a work as this, if knowing perlons had not generally allured mee that thele Authors were the molf un- qUcftionable Witt this Kingdomc hath afforded. Mr. Beaumont was ever acknow¬ ledged a man of a molf ftrong and fearching braine; and ("hisyeares confidered"! the moll Judicious Wit thefe later Ages have produced j he dyed young, for 1 which was an invaluable lofle to this Nation) he left the world when hee was not full thirty yearesold. Mr. Fletcher fiirvived, and lived till almoft fifty ; whereof the World now enjoyes the benefit. It was once in my thoughts to have Printed Mr. Fletcher's workes by themfelves,becaufe fingle & alone he would make a fuB Volume: But fince never parted while they lived, I conceived it not equitable to feperate their afhes. It becomes not me to fay ("though it bcaknowneTruth) that thefe Authors had not only High unexpreflible gifts of Nature, but alfo excellent acquired Parts, being furnilhed with Arts and Sciences by that liberall education chey had at the Vnvoerfity^ which furc is the beft place to make a great Wit underftand it leJfe;this their workes will foone make evident. I was very ambitious to have got Mr. Beaumont 1 pi&ure ; but could not poffibly,though I fpared no enquirie in thofe Noble Families whence he was dcfcended, as alfo among thofe Gentlemen that were his acquaintance when he was of the Inner Temple : the beft Pi&ures and thofe moll like him you'I finde in this Volume. This figure of Mr. Fletcher was cut by fevcrall Originall Pieces, which his friends lent me,but withall they tell me, that his unimitable Soule did Ihine through his countenance in liich Ayre and Spirit, that the Painters confefled it, was not eafie to exprefle him : As much as could be, you have here,and the Graver hath done his part. What ever I have feenc of Mr. Fletchers ownehand, is free from interlining; and his friends affirme he never writ any one thing twice : it feemes he had that rare felicity to prepare and perfe& all firft in his owne braine; to fhape and attire his Notions, to adde or loppe ofl^ before he committed one word to writing, and never touched pen till all was to Hand as firme and immutable as if ingraven in Braffe or Marble. But I keepe you too long from thofe friends of his whom'tis fitter for you j to read; only accept of the honeft endeavours of > . • W M j One that is a Servant to you all At the Princes Armes in " S1 Pauls Church-yard.

And what's the Loadjione can fitch guefls invite But moves on two Poles, Profit, and Delight, Which will be foou, as on the Rackb confefl When every one is tickled with a jeji : And that pure Fletcher, abletofnbdue A Melancholy more then Burton knew. And though upon the by, to his dejignes The Native may learne Englifhfrom bis lines, - And th-Alien if he can but conjlrue it, May here be made free Denifon ofwit.

That honour is reflgnd to Fletchers/^wze; .. ' Adde to his Trophies, that a Poets name ( Late growne as odious to our Moderne Bates As that of Ring to Rome) he vindicates From blackafpertiotis,caft upon t by thofe Which only are injpir'd to lye inprofe. And,By the Court of Mufes be't decreed, What graces fpringfrom Poe fys richer feed, When we name Fletcher fhall be fa proclaim'd, As all that's Royall is when Cxfar's nam A. ROBERT STAPYLTON Knight.

To the memorie or Mafter F LETC HER. T Here's nothing gain d by being witty : Fame Gathers but wmde to blather up a name. Orpheus mujl leave his lyre, or if it be In heav'n, 'tis there a Jigne, no harmony y Andft ones, that follow d him, may now become Nowft ones againe , andferve him for his Tomb. The Theban Linus, that was ably ski I'd In Mufc and Muftcke, was by Phoebus kiU'd, Though P hoebus did beget him: fure his Art Had merited his balfame, not his dart. But here Apollo's jealoufte is feene, The god of Phyftckj troubled with the fpleene y Lik? timerous Kings he puts a period To high grown parts left he ftjottld be no God. Hence thofe great Mafter-wits of Greece that gave Life to the world, could not avoid a grave. Hence the infpired Prophets of old Rome Too great for earth fled to Elizium. But the fame Ojlracifme benighted one, To whom allthefe were but illufton^ It tooke our Fletcher hence, Fletcher, whofe wit Was not an accident to th'foule, but It y Onely dijfus'd. (Thus wee the fame Sun call., Moving it'h Sphere, andfhining on a wall.) Wit,fo high plac'd at fir ft, it could not climbe, Wit, that ne'regrew, but only ft)ow'd by time.
