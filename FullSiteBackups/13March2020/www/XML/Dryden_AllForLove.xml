the People was not asJ^d or needed , but this were only by
Conquering abroad to be poor at home : And the Examples

Preface.




.He death o^Anthotiy and Cleopatra^ is a SubjeiS: whicli
has been treated by the greateft Wits of our Nation,
after shakefpeare 5 and by all fo varioufly, that their
example has given me the confidence to try my felf
in this Bowe of Vlyjfes amongft the Crowd of Su-
tors 5 and, withal, to take my own meafures, in aiming at the
Mark. I doubt not but the fame Motive has prevailed with all of
us in this attempt 5 I mean the excellency of the Moral : for the
chief perfons reprefented, were famous patterns of unlawful loves
and their end accordingly wag unfortunate. All reafonable men
have long fince concluded, That th-e Heroe of the Poem, ought
not to be a charafter of perfect Virtue, for, then, he could nor,
without injuftice, be made unhappy, nor yet altogether wicked,
becapfe he could not then be pitied : I have therefore fteer'd the
roiddle courfe, and have drawn the charader o^ AMhony zs h^
vourably as Plutarch^ j^ppian^ and Dion Cajfius wou'd give me
leave : the like I have obferv'd in Cleopatra. That which is want-
ing to work up the pity to a greater heighth, was not afforded me
by the ftory : for the crimes of love which they both committed,
were not occafion'd by any neceffity, or fatal ignorance, but were
wholly voluntary 5 fince our paflions are, or ought to be, with-
la our power. The Fabrick of the Play is regular enough, as to
the inferior parts of it 5 and the Unities of Time, Place and Adi-
on, more exaftly obferv'd , than, perhaps, the Englifh Theater
requires. Particularly, the A6i-ion is fo much one, that it is the
only of the kind without Epifode, or Underplot 5 every Ccene
in the Tragedy conducing to the main defign, and every Ad con-
eluding with a turn of it. The greateft errour in the contrivance
feems to be in the perfon of O&avia : For, though I might ufe the
priviledge of a Poet, to introduce her into jiexafidria, yet I had
n-ot enough conflder'd, that the compaffion fhe mov'd to her felf
and children, was deflru(!l:ive to that which Ireferv'd for J^ihofiy

PREFACE.

kden the favour of the Audience to them, when Virtue and In-
nocence were opprefs'd by it. And, though I juftified AnthoKy
in feme meafure, by making O&avias departure, to proceed wholly
from her felf 5 yet the force of the firft Machine dill remained i
and the dividing of pity, like the cutting of a River into many
Channels, abated the ftrength of the natural ftream. But this is
an Objedion which none of my Critiques have urg'd againft me 5
and therefore I might have let it pafs, if I could have refolv'd to
have been partial to my felf. The faults my Enemies have found,
are rather cavils concerning little, and not eflential Decencies,
which a Mafler of the Ceremonies may decide betwixt us. The
French Poets 5 I confefs, are drift Obfervers of thefe Punftilio's :
They would not, for example, have fuffer'd Cleopatra and O^avia
to have met , or if they had met, there muft only have pafs'd be-
twixt them fome cold civilities, but no eagernefs of repartee, for
fear of offending againft the greatnefs of their Charadlers, and
the modefty of their Sex. This Objedion I forefaw, and at the
fame time contemn'd ; for I judg'd it both natural and probable,
that O&avfa , proud of her new-gain*d Conqueft, would fearch
out Cleopatra to triumph over her, and that Cleopatra^ thus at-
tacqu'd, was not of a fpirit to (hun the encounter: and 'tis not
unlikely, that two exafperated Rivals (hould ufe fuch Satyre as
I have put into their mouths j for after all^ though the one were
a Koman^ and the other a Queen, they were both Women. 'Tis
true, fome anions, though natural, are not fit tobereprefented,
and broad obfcenities in words , ought in good manners to be
avoided : exprefiions therefore are a modeft cloatfaing of our
thoughts, as Breeches and Petticoats are of our bodies. If I have
kept my felf within the bounds of modefty , all beyond it is but
nicety and afFeftation ? which is no more but modefty deprav'd
into a vice : they betray themfelves who are too quick of appre-
henfion in fuch cafes , and leave all reafonablc men to imagine
worfe of them, than of the Poet.

Honeft Montaigne goes yet farther : Nom ne jommts que cere-

My comfort is, that by this opinion my Enemies are but fucking
Critiques, who wou'd fain be nibbling ere their teech are come.

Yer, in this nicety of manners does the excellency of /"re^C/^
Poetry confift : their Heroes are the mod civil people breathing;
but their good breeding feldom extends to a word of fenfe: Ail
their Wit is in their Ceremony ^ they want the Genius which ani-
mates our Stage 5 and therefore 'tis but neceflary when they cannot
pleafe, that they (hould take care not to offend. But, as the
civileflman in the company is commonly the duUeft, fo thefe Au-
thors, while they are afraid to make you laugh or cry, out of
pure good manners, make you fleep. They are fo careful not to
exafperate a Critique, that they never leave him any work 5 fo
bufie with the Broom, and make fo clean a riddance, that there
is little left either for cenfure or for praife : for no part of a Poem
is worth our difcommending, where the whole is infipid , as wheri
we have once tafted of pall'd Wine, we ftay not to examine it
Glafs by Glafs. But while they affedt to (hine in trrfles, they are
often carelefs in efTentials. Thus their Hippolitus is fo fcrupulous
in point of decency, that he will rather expofe himfelf to death,
than accufe his Stepmother to his Father 5 and my Critiques I am
fure wili commend him for it ; but we of groffer apprehenfions,
are apt to think that this excefs of generofiiy, is not prafticable
but with Fools and Madmen. This was good manners with a ven-
geance ; and the Audience is like to be much coticernM at the
misfortunes of this admirable Heroe : but tdikt Hippolitus out of
his Poetique Fit, and I fuppofe he would think it a wifer parr, to
fet the Saddle on the right Horfe, and chufe rather to live with
the reputation of a plain-fpoken honeft man , than to die with
the infamy of an incefiuous Villain. In the mean time we may
take notice, that where the Poet ought to have preferv'd the cha-
radler as it was deliver'd to us by Antiquity, when he (hould
have given us thepifture of a rough young man, of the Amazo-
man (irzin^ a jolly Huntfman, and both by his profeffion and his
early rifing a Mortal Enemy to love, he has chofcn to give him the
turn of Gallantry, fent him to travel £tomJthens to Parts ^ taught
him to make love , and transformed the Hippolitus of Euripides

mt6VBr\(i^^^&rffolili I (hould not have troubled my felf thuj
far with French Poets , but that I find our Chedrettx Critiques
>vholly form their judgments b? them. But for my part, I de-
fire to be try'd by the Laws of my own Country 5 for it feems
unjuftto me, that the French (hould prefcribe here, till they have
conquer'd. Our little Sonnettiers who follow them, have too
narrow Souls to judge of Poetry. Poets themfeives are the moft^
proper^ though ! conclude not the only Critiques. But till fomc
Genius as Ilniverfal, as Arifi'otle^ (hall arifcj o-ne who can pene-
trate into all Arts and Sciences, without the pradice of them, I
ihall think it reafonable, that the Judgment of an Artificer in his
own Art (hould be preferable to the opinion of another man , at
lea ft where he is not brib'd by intereft, or prejudiced by malice :
and thi?, Ifuppofej is manifeftby plain induction: For, firft, the
Crowd cannot be prefumM to have more than a grofs inftin(3:, of
what pleaTes or difpleafes them : every man will grant me this 5
but then, by a particular kindnefs to himfelf, he draws his own
(lake firfV, and will be diffcingui(h'd from the multitude,, of which
other men may think him one. But, if! come clofer to thofe
who are allow'd for witty men,, either by the advantage of their
quality, or by common fame, and affirm that neither are they qua-
lified to decide Sovereignly, concerning Poetry, I (hall yet have
a ftrong party of my opinion j for moft of them feverally will ex-
clude the reil, either from the number of witty men, or at leaf^
of able Judges. But here again they are all indulgent to them-
feives : and every one who believes himfelf a Wit, that is, every
man^will pretend at the fame time to a rightof j-udging.Butto prefs
it yet farther, there are many witty men, but few Poets 5 neither
have all Poets a taf^e of Tragedy. And this is the flock on which
they are daily fplitting. Poetry, which is a Pidure of Nature,
znuft generally pleafTe : but *tis not to be underftood that all parts
of it mufl: pleafe every man «, therefore is not Tragedy to be judg'd
Iby a witty man, whofe tafte is only confin'd to Comedy. Nor is
every man who loves TrageJiy a fufScient Judge of it .'he mu(t
wnderRand the excellencies of it too, or he will only prove a blind
Admker, not a Critique. From hence it comes that fo many Sa-
tyrs on Poets, and ceufures of their Writing?, fly abroad. Mea

their concernment : fome Poem of their own. is to be produc'd,,
and the Slaves are to belaid flat with their faces on the ground^,
that the Monarch may appear in the greater M^jefty.

Dionyfus and Ner<? had the fame longings , but with all their^
power they cou'd never bring their buiioefs well about. 'Tis true^ ,
they proclaim'd themfelves Poets by found of Trumpet 5 and Po-
ets they were upon pain of death lo any man who durft call thenu
otherwife. The Audience had a fine time on't, you mayima-^
gine '1 they fate in a bodily fear, and look'd as demurely as they
could: for 'twas a hanging matter to laugh unfeafonably 5 andi
the Tyrants were fufpicious, as they had reafon, that their. Sub--

as good a face upon the bufiaefs as he could : Twas known before-
hand that the iVTonarchs were to be Crown'd Laureats , but when
the (hew was over, and an hotieft -man was fufFer'd to depart
quietly, he took out his laughter which he had (liffled v with a
firm refolution never more to fee an Emperor's Play, though he
"had been ten years a making it. In the mean time the true Poets
were they who made the beft Markets, for they had Wit enough
to yield the Prize with a good grace, and not contend with him
who had thirty Legions : They were fure to be rewarded if they
confefs'd themfelves bad Writers, and that was fomewhat better
than to be Martyrs for their reputation. Lucan's example was
enough to teach them manners j and after he was put to death,
for overcoming Nero^ the Emperor carried it without difpute for
the bed Poet in his Dominions : No man was ambitious of that
grinning honour, for if he heard the malicious Trumpetcer pro-
claiming his name before his betters, he knew there was but one
-way with him. Mecevas took another courfe, and we know he
was more than a great man , for he was witty too: but finding
hirafelf far gone in Poetry, which Seneca a (lures us was not his
Talent, he t4iought it his beft way to be well with VirgH and
v^'iihHorace 5 that at leaft he might be a Poet at the fecond hand 5
and we fee how happily it has fucceeded with him , for his own
bad Poetry is forgotten 5 and their Panegyricks of him ftill re-
main. But they who (hould be our Patrons, are for no fuch ex-
penfive ways to fame : they have much of the Poetry of Mecevas,
but little of his liberality. They are for perfecuting Hf^r^^eand
Virgil^ in the perfons of their Succeffors, (for fuch is every man,
who has any part of their Soul and Fire, though in a leffe degree,)
Some of their little Zanies yet go farther 5 for they are Perfecu-
tors even of Horace himfelf, as far as they are able, by their igno-
rant and vile imitations of him 5 by making an unjuft ufe of his
Authority , and turning his Artillery againft his Friends. But
how would he difdain to be Copyed by fuch hands 1 I dare an-
fwer for him, he would be more uneafiein their company, than
he was with Crifpinus their Forefather in the Holj lVay\ and
would no more have allow 'd them a place amongft the Critiques,
than he would Demetrius the Mimique, an.d Tigcllius the Bu(roon;

With what fcof n would he look down on fuch miferable Tranfla-
tors, who make Doggrel of his Latine, miftake his meaning, mif-
apply his cenfuresj and often contradi^ their own ? He is fix'd
as a Land-Mark to fet out the bounds of Poetry,

— m^Saxum^ antiquum ingens

But other Arm's than theirs, and other Sinews are required, t(*

For my part, I would wifli no other revenge, either for my felf
or the reft of the Poets, from this Rhyming Judge of the Twelve-
penny Gallery, this Legitimate Son of sternhold^ than that he
would fubfcribe his Name to his cenfure, or (not to tax him be-
yond his learning ) fet his Mark : for ftiou'd he own himfelf
publickly, and come from behind the Lyons Skin, they whona
he condemns vvou'd be thankful to him , they \yhom he praifes
wou'd cbufe to be condemned 5 and the Magiftrates whom he has
elected, wou'd modeftly withdraw from their employment, tO:
avoid the fcandal of his nomination. The fharpnefs of his Satyr^
next to himfelfj falls moft heavily on his Friends, and they ought
never to forgive him for commending them perpetually the wrong;
way, and fometimes by contraries. If he have a Friend whofe
haftinefs in writing is his greateft fault, Horace wou'd have taught
him to have minc'd the matter, and to have calFd it readinefs of
thought, and a flowing fancy 5 for friendflhip will allow a man to
Chriften an imperfeffcion by the name of fome neighbour virtue s:

Vellem in afmcitia fc erraremus 5 d^ ifii

Errori^ nomen virtm pofuifjet hone^um.
But he would never have allow'd him to have call'd a (low mat^
hafty, or a hafty Writer a flow Drudge, as Juvenal explains its.

leave him to interpret this by the benefit of his French Verfion
on the other iide, and without farther confidering him, than I
have the reft of my illiterate Cenfors, whom I have difdain*d to
^nfwer, becaufe they are not qualified for Judges. It reniains
that I acquaint the Reader, that I have endeavoured in this Play
tG follow the praftife of the Ancients, who, as Mv.RytHer has judi-
c'loufly obferv'd, are and ought to be our Mafters. Homce like-

I could give an inftance in the Oedipus tyrannm^ which was the
Mafterpiece o( Sophocles '^ but I referve it for a more fit occafion,
which I hope to have hereafter. In my Stile I have profbfs'd to
imitate the Divine shahsfpcare > which that I might perform more
freely, I have difincumber'd my felf from Rhyme. Not that I
condemn my former way, but that this is more proper to my pre-
fent purpofe. I hope I need not to explain my felf, that I have
not Copy'd my Author fer vilely : Words and Phrafes muft of ne-
ceflity receive a change in fucceeding Ages: but 'tis almoft a Mi-
racle that much of his Language remains fo pure 5 and that he
who began Dramatique Poetry amongft us, untaught by any, and,
zsBcn 'johvfon ttWs us, without Learning, (hould by the force of
his own Genius perform fo much, that in a manner he has left no
praife for any who come after him. The occafion is fair, and the
fubjedi: would be pleafant to handle the difference of Stiles betwixt
him and Fletcher, and wherein, and how far they are both to be
imitated. But fince I muft not be over-confident of my own per-
formance after him, it will be prudence in me to be filent. Yet
I hope I may affirm, and without vanity, that by imitating him,
I have exceird my felf throughout the Play 5 and particularly,
that I prefer the Scene becwixt Anthovy and Ventidius in the firft
Adi, to any thing which I have written in this kind.

Serap, ^ ^"^^ Ortents, and Prodigies, are grown (o Frequent,
That they have loft their Name. Our fruitful

Nile
Flow'd ere the wonted Seafon^ with a Torrent
So unexpedtedj and fo wondrous fierce.
That the wild Deluge overtook the hafte
Ev'n of the Hinds that watch'd it : Men and Beafts
Were born above the tops of Trees, that grew
On th' utmoft Margin of the Water-mark.
Then, with fo fwift an Ebb, the Floud drove backward
It flipt from underneath the Sealy Herd :
Here monftroiis vhocce panted on the Shore 5
Forfaken Dolphins there, with their broad tails.
Lay lalhing the departing Waves ; Hard by 'em,
Sea-Horfcs floundring in the (limy mud,
Tofs'd up their heads, and dafh'd the ooze about *em«
Efiter Alexas behind them,
Myr, kvtit thefe Omens, Heav'n.

B Scrap,



a M for LOVE- or,

Sera^. Lall: night, between the hours of Twelve and One,
In a lone Ifle o'th' Temple while I walk'd,
A Whirl-wind rofe, that, with a violent blaft,
Shook all the D^^^e : the Doors around me clapt.
The Iron Wicket, that defends the Vault,
Where the long Race of P/^/^7»ie/ is lay'd,
Burfl: open, anddifclos'd the mighty dead.
From out each Monument, in order plac'd.
An Armed Ghoft ftart up : the Boy-King laft
Kear'd his inglorious head, A peal of groans
Then follow'd, and a lamentable voice
Cry'd, JEgypt is no more. My blood ran back.
My (haking knees againft each other knock'd j
Gn the cold pavement down I fell intranc'd^
And fo unfinifh'd left the horrid Scene,
^te^z/'^n?-") AndjDream'd you this ? or, Did invent the Story >
ing hif^jfelf.) To frighten our J^.gypian Boys withal ^
And train 'em up betimes in fearof Priedhood ?

Scrap, My Lord, f faw you not,
Nor meant my words Qiould reach your ears j but what
I uttered was moft true.

Alex, A foolifh Dream,
Bred from the fumes of indigefted Feadsj
And holy Luxury.

Scra]^, I know my duty :
This goes no farther,

Alex, 'Tis not fit it fhonld.
Nor would the times now bear it, were it true.
All Southern, from yon hills, the Roman Camp
Hangs o'er us black and threatning, like a Storm
Juft breaking on our heads,

Serap, Our faint Egyptians pray for Antofiy^
But in their Servile hearts they own oSavius,

Myr.SNhy then does Antony dream out his hours.
And tempts not Fortune for a noble Day,
Which might redeem, what AUium loft ?
Ahx, He thinks 'tis paft recovery,
SiYaf, Yet the Foe
Seems not to prefs the Siege^



Tie 'W QKVD mil lofl. -

'Alex. Oj there's the wonder.
Mectenas and Jgrippa^ who can moil:
With C(efary are his Foes, His Wife O&aviay
Driv'n from his Houfe, folicits her revenges
And Dolabella^ who was once his Friend,
Upon fome private grudge, now feekshis ruine:
Yet ftill War feems on either fide to fleep,

Serap. Tis ftrange that Antony^ for fome dayes paft
Has not beheld the face of Cleopatra 5
But here, in //Fj Temple, lives retir'd.
And makes his heart a prey to black defpair.

Alex, 'Tis true 5 and we much fear he hopes by abfeoce
To cure his mind of Love.

Serap, If hebe vanquifh'd,
Or make his peace, ^'.gypt is doom'd to be
A Roman Province 5 and our plenteous Harvefts
Muft then redeem the fcarcenefs of their Soil.
While Antony ftood firm, our Alexandria
Rival'd proud Rome ( Dominions other Seat)
And Fortune ftriding, like a vaft Coloffus^
Cou'd fix an equal foot of Empire here.

Alex, Had I my wi(li, thefe Tyrants of all Nature
Who Lord it o*er Mankind, fhould perifh, perifli^
Each by the others Sword ^ but, fince our will
Is lamely foUow'd byourpow*r,we muft
Depend on one 5 with him to rife or fall.

Serap, How ftands the Queen afFe<^ed ?

Alex, O, fhe dotes.
She doteS;> 4yer<:?]?7<7«, on this vanquifh'd Man,
And winds her felf about his mighty ruins.
Whom would fhe yet forfake, yet yield him up,
This hunted prey, to his purfuers hands.
She might prefer ve us all 5 but 'tis in vain — — •
This changes my defigns, this blafts my Counfels,
And makes me ufe all means to keep him here.
Whom I could wifh divided from her Arms
Far as the Earth's deep Center. Well, you know
The flate of things 5 no more of your ill Omens,
And black Prognofticks j labour to confirm
The peoples hearts. B 2 Enter

A mortal foe he was to uSj and .^gypt.

A braver EVoman never drew a Sword.

He ne'r was of his pleafures, but prefides

In fhort, the plainnefs^fiercenefs, rugged virtue

And bounds into a Vice that bears him far
From his firft courfe^ and plunges him in ills :
Bur, when his danger makes him find his faultj
Quick to obferve, and full of (harp remorfe.
He cenfures eagerly his own mifdeeds,

And not forgiving what as Man he did,
Becaufs his other parts are more than Man.

That gave the World a Lord : 'tis Antonys,

Be this the general voice fent up to Heav'n,
And every publick place repeat this eccho.
