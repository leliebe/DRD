SCENE I



Enter Chariot and Juliana in Mens Cloaths.

JU L. Faitb, Chariot, the Breeches become you fo well 'tis almoft pity you
(hould ever part with *em.
Char. Nor will I, till I can find one can make better ufe of them to
beliow 'em on, and then I'll refign my Title to 'em for ever.

Jul. 'Tis well if you find it fo eafie, for a Woman once vefted in Au-
thority, tho' 'tis by no other than her own making, does not willingly part
with it : But, prithee Child, what is thy Defign ? for I am yet to learn.
• Char. Why, to ramble the Town till I can meet with the Man I can find in
my heart to take for b-^tter for woife. Thefe Qoaths will give us greater Li-
berty than the fcandaloiis World will allow to our Petticoats, which we could
not attempt this Undertaking in without hazard to ocr Modefty. Befides,
fiiould I meet with the Man whole outfide pleafcs me, 'twill be impoillble by
any other means to dilcover his Humour; for they are fo ufed to flatter and
deceive our Sex, that there's nothing but the Angel appears, tho' the Devil lies
liuking within, and never fo much as (hews his Paw till he has got his Prey
fait in his Clutches.

Jul Methinks you that have fo true a Notion of that treacherous Sex,
fhould be afraid to venter for fear of being your felf deceived.

4^ o B Char.



she Venters,

.. Ckir. No, ray dear Julia, to avoid it is the fcope of my DeHgn \ for, tiio'

Ky L^zinefs and'EafethegeneraJity of Mankind is degenerated into a fQfcEife-

Jliiinacy, unworthy of the noble Stamp was fct upon their Soul, there ftill re-

f mains a Race retains the Image Heaven made them in, Vertuous, and Juft,Sin-

Icere and Brave : And fiicha onePIl find, if I fearch to the Antipdes for him,

or elfe lead Apes in Hell.

Jul. But, Dear Child, will not every one thmk you ftark madforaHul-
band, to take this extravagant courfe for one ?
char. No fure; none can think ©ne of my Youth and Fortune can
tf. want the Tenders of Hearts enough ; I'm not obliged to follow the World's
dull Maxims, nor will I wait for the formal Addrefs of fome Ceremonious
Coxcomb, with more Land than Brains, who would bargain for us as he would
for his Horfe, and t^ilks of nothing but Taxes and hard Times, to make me
a good Houfewife ; or elfe fome gay young flattering Thing, who calls him-
felf a Beau, and wants my Fortune to maintain him in that Charader:
Such an opinionated Animal, who believes there needs no more to reach a
Ladies Heart than a boon mien, fine Drefs, the Perriwig well adjufted, the
Hand well managed in taking Snuff, to (hew the fine Diamond Ring, if he's
worth one ; fometimes a conceited Laugh, with the Month ftretchM from one
Ear to t'other, to difcover the white Teeth, with fneak and cringe in an aiTeded
Tone, cries Damn me, Madam, if you are not the piettieft Creature my Eyes
ere faw ! 'Tis impoITible for me to live if yoii are To cruel to deny me ; wirh
a world of fuch foolifh ftutf, which they talk all by rote; no, my Julia, I'll
have one who loves my Perfon as well as Gold, and pleafe my felf, not the
World, in my choice.

Jul Is there's any fuch thing as real Love in that falfe Sex, none (lire is fo
capable to infpire it, as the charming Chariot, your Perfon is indeed infinitely
raking, your Humour gay, and Wit refined, and Beauty enough to tempt
a Hermit ; yet, after all, you'll find it a difficult bufinefs to diftiiiguifii, which
the moft zealous Adorations are paid to, your Beauty, or Gold.

Char. I warrant thee, Child, V\\ take Care of that : But come, to our Af-
fairs in hand.

Jul. Where's your Brother.^ , ^^ "•-',./;

Char. He's fafe enough, he dined to D^y at Sir Roger A/^^rw; W's, whete^ 'tis
twenty to one, he'll be ingaged the Evening.

Jul Suppofe he fliould meet us in our Rambles, he'd certainly know
us.

Cy^^r. You're fo full of your Suppofitions ; fiippofe he fliould, which there's
no great danger of, but at the Play Houfe, where we'll firft ftear our Courfe;
he's too difcreet to difcover us, and too good humoui'd to be angry, but
will think it one of my mad Frolicks, without other Delign, but a little Di-
verfion. But I know from whence your Fear proceeds ; which, if you put
any more Scruples into my Head, Til difcover ; therefore look to your good
Behaviour.

■ ■ j^«^- h^i^ I confers you have me at an Advantage, but that has now no part
in my defign, to ferve you with that little Wit I have ; there's a Coach waits
us at the Garden-Gate.

Mnfick.

Sir Char. I think Sir Roger , we miifl give my Sifter, and Cozen Julia,
an ElTay of our Serenade -^ the Song is pretty, and may properly be ^-
plied fo any of the fair Sex .- But is it not very gallant to treat a Sifter
thus?

Sir Roger. 1 believe , Sir Charks , if Madam Juliana had not a greater
Ihare in it than your Sifter , (he'd lofe her part in this Entertain-
ment.

Sir Char. I muft own my fair Cozen has charmed me; but I have of
late oblerv'd her grown fo thoughtful , 1 fear her Heart already is en-
gaged, which makes me fear to own any Pretenfions to it.

Sir Roger. She cannot (iv^ be infenfible lo the Brother of Chariot, whom
^e fo tenderly loves ; advance your Addrefles, you have a good Ad-
vocate.-

Sir Char. No, I'll fee that Mad Sifter of min8 difpos'd of firft : Pd
give Five Hundred Guineas to Tee her in love; for I dare nofi own my
being fo, till {hes a little tamed. She'll only make me her fport, asfhe
does all Mankind befidei.

Sir Roger. I think Sir Char, you (hould rather give it to fecure her
from it if poffible ; for ivhat Afiiirancc have you fhe will not blind
with' that madlpaffionj be betrayed to match her felf to one unworthy
of her Merit , and bring an Alliance to your Family, you'd blufn to

Sir CK^r. No, 1 dare fwear fox her; however ffolJkkfome Hie is inner-
'Humour, Ihe'd fcorn to look on any Thing was bafely born : but I
have often' heard her declare fhe would , when ever fiie married,
match her felf -where Oie found more Merit than Eftate. I know fo
well her Pride in that Concern, I dare truft the Honour of our Family in
the Hands.

' SirRog;. Then if (he fhould throw her felf away upon fome weil-born
younger Brottier, not worth a Groat, I find you would eafily forgive
her.

Sir Char. She has a plentiful Fortune, enough to make any Man hap-
py ; (he's free and abfolute, and has as much Right to difpofe of her felf
and Fortune as 1 of mine.

^SirJRog. It argues but little Kindnefs, for your Sifter to be fo carelefs of
her Advantage.

Sir Char. You need not inftruft me in my Kindnefs for my Siller, (he-
never found any want of it, nor fhall fhe. But whence conaesyour Con-
cern for her. Sir Roger ?
